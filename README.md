# Exp_Data_Analysis_Project_1
Project 1 for the Coursera course Exploratory Data Analysis

This R script generates a variety of plots based on the Electric power consumption dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

# Files

The following files are included in the repository:

- README.md - This document

- create_plots.R - R script to generate plots based on the Electric power consumption dataset. The script requires the extracted dataset to be present in the working directory (household_power_consumption.txt)

- plot1.png - First plot required for project

- plot2.png - Second plot required for project

- plot3.png - Third plot required for project

- plot4.png - Fourth plot required for project


# Description of Dataset

Dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip [20Mb]


Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption:
	
1.Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 

2.Time: time in format hh:mm:ss 

3.Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 

4.Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 

5.Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 

6.Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 

7.Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 

8.Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 

9.Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
